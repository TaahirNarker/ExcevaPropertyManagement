# Strike API Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to securely set up your Strike API credentials:

1. Copy the template to your .env file:

```bash
cp env_template_bitcoin.txt .env
```

2. Edit the .env file and add your Strike API key:

```
STRIKE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.strike.me/v1
STRIKE_API_KEY=C76F8D791A36EBF6583B3E25BBF316CE316A70AB3507EA6A4628C3DAD4CO1FBF
STRIKE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret-here  # You'll need to get this from Strike dashboard
```

3. Set your production domain for payment URLs:

```
PAYMENT_BASE_URL=https://propman.exceva.capital/pay
ADMIN_BASE_URL=https://propman.exceva.capital
PAYMENT_NOTIFICATION_EMAILS=admin@exceva.capital,manager@exceva.capital
```

4. Set up your webhook URL in Strike dashboard:
   - Log in to your Strike account
   - Navigate to API settings
   - Add a webhook endpoint: https://propman.exceva.capital/api/payments/webhook/strike/
   - Subscribe to these events:
     - invoice.created
     - invoice.updated
     - invoice.paid
     - invoice.canceled
   - Copy the webhook secret and add it to your .env file

5. Test your configuration by restarting the server and checking logs:
   ```bash
   # You should see "âœ… Strike API key configured successfully" in the logs
   python3 manage.py runserver 8000
   ```

IMPORTANT: Keep your API keys secure! Never commit them to version control or share them publicly.
