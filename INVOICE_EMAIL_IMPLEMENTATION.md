```env
# ZOHO Mail SMTP Configuration
EMAIL_BACKEND=django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.zoho.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
EMAIL_USE_SSL=False

# Your ZOHO Mail credentials
EMAIL_HOST_USER=noreply@rentpilot.co.za
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-zoho-app-password-here

# Default email addresses
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@rentpilot.co.za
SERVER_EMAIL=noreply@rentpilot.co.za

# Invoice-specific email settings
INVOICE_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@rentpilot.co.za
INVOICE_REPLY_TO_EMAIL=admin@rentpilot.co.za

ADMIN_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### 3. Test Email Configuration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Emails not sending**:
   - Verify ZOHO app password is correct
   - Check that your domain is verified in ZOHO
   - Ensure EMAIL_USE_TLS=True and EMAIL_PORT=587
   - Run the test script for detailed error messages

2. **PDF generation errors**:
   - Make sure reportlab is installed
   - Check that invoice has required data (tenant, property, etc.)
   - Verify template permissions

3. **Permission errors**:
   - Ensure user has access to the invoice
   - Check Django permissions and authentication

### Debugging

1. **Check Django logs**:
   ```bash
   tail -f backend/logs/django.log
   ```

2. **Test email manually**:
   ```python
   python manage.py shell
   from django.core.mail import send_mail
   send_mail('Test', 'Test message', 'noreply@rentpilot.co.za', ['your-email@domain.com'])
   ```

3. **Test PDF generation**:
   ```python
   python manage.py shell
   from finance.models import Invoice
   from finance.utils import generate_invoice_pdf
   invoice = Invoice.objects.first()
   pdf = generate_invoice_pdf(invoice)
   ```

## Security Considerations

- Never commit real passwords to git
- Use app-specific passwords, not your ZOHO login password
- Keep email credentials secure in environment variables
- Monitor email sending for abuse
- Implement rate limiting for production use

## Next Steps

1. **Test the implementation** with real invoices
2. **Customize email templates** with your branding
3. **Set up monitoring** for email delivery
4. **Configure production settings** for your live environment
5. **Add email tracking** (optional) to monitor open rates

## Support

If you need help with the implementation:

1. Run the test script first to identify issues
2. Check the Django logs for detailed error messages
3. Verify your ZOHO Mail configuration
4. Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly

The system is now ready to send professional invoices via email! ðŸŽ‰
