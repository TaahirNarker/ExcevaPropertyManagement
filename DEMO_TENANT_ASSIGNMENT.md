# 🏠 Tenant Assignment Feature Demo Guide

## 🎯 What You Can Now Do

Previously, properties showed as "Vacant" but there was no way to assign tenants to them. Now you can easily assign tenants to vacant properties directly from the properties list!

## 🚀 How to Use the New Feature

### Step 1: Navigate to Properties
1. Go to your dashboard
2. Click on "Properties" in the navigation
3. You'll see your properties list

### Step 2: Find Vacant Properties
- Look for properties with a **green "Vacant" badge**
- Below the "Vacant" status, you'll now see a blue **"Assign Tenant" button**

### Step 3: Assign a Tenant
1. Click the **"Assign Tenant" button** for any vacant property
2. A modal will open with tenant assignment options

### Step 4: Fill in the Assignment Details
The modal includes:
- **Tenant Selection**: Dropdown showing available tenants
- **Lease Dates**: Start and end dates for the lease
- **Financial Terms**: Monthly rent and optional deposit
- **Tenant Information**: Details about the selected tenant

### Step 5: Complete the Assignment
1. Select a tenant from the dropdown
2. Set the lease start and end dates
3. Enter the monthly rent amount
4. Optionally add a deposit amount
5. Click **"Assign Tenant"**

### Step 6: See the Results
- The property status will automatically change from "Vacant" to "Occupied"
- A lease agreement is automatically created
- The properties list refreshes to show the new status

## 🔍 What Happens Behind the Scenes

## 🚨 Important Notes

### What You Need

### What Gets Created
- **New Lease**: With 'pending' status
- **Property Update**: Status changes to 'occupied'
- **Audit Trail**: Full record of the assignment

### What Gets Validated
- **Property Status**: Must be vacant
- **Tenant Availability**: Must not have existing active leases
- **Date Logic**: Start date must be before end date
- **Required Fields**: Tenant, dates, and rent amount

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **No "Assign Tenant" button visible**
   - Check if property is actually vacant
   - Verify you have permission to manage the property

2. **No tenants in dropdown**
   - All active tenants may already have leases
   - Check if tenants exist in the system

3. **Assignment fails**
   - Verify all required fields are filled
   - Check if property status changed while you were working
   - Ensure tenant is still available
